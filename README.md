### Getting Started
If you don't have Visual Studio already, download [Visual Studio 2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/community/). When prompted in the Visual Studio Installer, make sure to select at least "Desktop .NET Development."

You should then be able to open the `Print3DCloud.sln` solution in Visual Studio and simply build and run the project.
